        <p><b> Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose</b> was an Indian Nationalist whose patriotism towards India has left a mark
            in
            the hearts of many Indians. He is famously known as the founder of <b>'Azad Hind Fauj'</b> and his famous
            slogan
            is <b>'Tum Mujhe Khoon Do, Main Tumhe Aazadi Dunga'</b>. He formed Azad Hind Fauj and made several
            contributions
            to India's freedom struggle. He is known for his militant approach that he used to gain independence and for
            his

        <h3># Family history and early life</h3>
        <p>Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose was born on 23 January, 1897 in Cuttack (Orissa) to Prabhavati Dutt Bose and
            Janakinath Bose.
            His father was a successful lawyer in Cuttack and received the title of "Rai Bahadur".
            He did his schooling from the Protestant European School (presently Stewart High School) in Cuttack, just
            like
            his siblings.
            He did baccalaureate from the Presidency College. He was influenced by the teachings of Swami Vivekananda
            and
            Ramakrishna after reading their works at the age of 16.
            He then was sent by his parents to the University of Cambridge in England to prepare for the Indian Civil
            Service.
            In 1920 he passed the civil service examination, but in April 1921, after hearing of the nationalist
            turmoils in
            India, he resigned his candidacy and hurried back to India.

        <h3># Subhas Chandra Bose and Indian National Congress</h3>
        <img class="netaji" src="Netaji3.jpg" alt="Netaji">
        <p>He joined Non-Cooperation Movement which was started by Mahatama Gandhi who made INC a powerful non-violent
            organization.
            During the movement, he was advised by Mahatma Gandhi to work with Chittaranjan Das who became his political
            guru.
            After that, he became a youth educator and commandant of the Bengal Congress volunteers.
            He started the newspaper 'Swaraj'.
            In 1927, after being released from prison, Bose became general secretary of the Congress party and worked
            with
            Jawaharlal Nehru for independence.
        </p>
        <p>In 1938 he was elected president of the Indian National Congress and formed a national planning committee,
            which
            formulated a policy of broad industrialization.
            However, this did not harmonize with Gandhian economic thought, which clung to the notion of cottage
            industries
            and benefiting from the use of the country's own resources.
            Bose's vindication came in 1939 when he defeated a Gandhian rival for reelection.
            Nonetheless, the “rebel president” felt bound to resign because of the lack of Gandhi's support.

        <h3># Subhas Chandra Bose and Indian National Army (INA) or Azad Hind Fauz</h3>
        <img class="netaji" src="Netaji2.jpg" alt="Netaji">
        <p>An important development in the struggle for freedom during the Second World War was the formation and
            activities
            of the Azad Hind Fauj, also known as the Indian National Army, or INA.
            Rash Behari Bose, an Indian revolutionary who had escaped from India and had been living in Japan for many
            years, set up the Indian independence league with the support of Indians living in the countries of
            south-east
            Asia.
        </p>
        <p>
            When Japan defeated the British armies and occupied almost all the countries of south-East Asia, the league
            formed the Indian National Army from among the Indian prisoners of war with the aim of liberating India from
            British rule.
            General Mohan Singh, who had been an officer in the British Indian army, played an important role in
            organizing
            this army.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Indian nationalist movement did not view the Japanese government as a friend of India.
            Its sympathies were with the people of those countries which had fallen victims to Japan's aggression.
            Netaji, however, believed that with the help of the Azad Hind Fauj, supported by Japan, and a revolt inside
            India, the British rule over India could be ended.
            The Azad Hind Fauj, with the slogan of 'Delhi Chalo and the salutation Jai Hind was a source of inspiration
            to
            Indians, inside and outside the country.
            Netaji rallied together with the Indians of all religions and regions, living in southeast Asia, for the
            cause
            of India's freedom.
